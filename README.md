# 📚 My Learning Projects

Welcome to this repository! This is a personal space where I keep my learning projects, experiments, and notes.

## 👤 About Me

I am not from a Computer Science background, but I use this place to:

**🧑‍💻 Practice coding through small projects**

**✍️ Write down thoughts about what each piece of code means to me**

**🔍 Reflect on the process of learning step by step**

## ✨ My Perspective

For me, every line of code is more than just instructions for a machine. It carries meaning, logic, and sometimes even creativity. That’s why I want to document not only the what but also the why behind my work.

## 🚀 Explore

Feel free to explore, and maybe some of my notes or projects can be useful or inspiring to you as well.
